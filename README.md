# Notes

## Resizing the Window

to resize the window, adjust

```
[display]

window/size/viewport_width=320
window/size/viewport_height=180
window/size/window_width_override=1920
window/size/window_height_override=1080
window/stretch/mode="canvas_items"
```

## Delta

`move_and_slide()` uses `delta` internally, so it is not required to multiply the velocity by delta. if you build your own movement system, however, make sure to use delta to compensate for framerate.

## Position

a node has a `position` property and `global_position` property. the first is always relative to its parent, while the latter is always relative to world space, i.e. the global `(0,0)` origin. depending on the use case, use one or the other.
