# Notes

## Resizing the Window

to resize the window, adjust

```
[display]

window/size/viewport_width=320
window/size/viewport_height=180
window/size/window_width_override=1920
window/size/window_height_override=1080
window/stretch/mode="canvas_items"
```

## Delta

`move_and_slide()` uses `delta` internally, so it is not required to multiply the velocity by delta. if you build your own movement system, however, make sure to use delta to compensate for framerate.

## Position

a node has a `position` property and `global_position` property. the first is always relative to its parent, while the latter is always relative to world space, i.e. the global `(0,0)` origin. depending on the use case, use one or the other.

## Call Deferred

when changing physics properties inside the physics loop, use `call_deferred`, as described here:

> This is a common problem people have, just as the message says, you can't manipulate the physics state inside of a physics lifecycle callback.
>
> Your \_on_HitBox_area_entered function has a line that disables a collision shape $HitBox/CollisionShape2D.disabled = true. This is a no-no.
>
> You can do something like this instead:

```
func _on_HitBox_area_entered(area):
    call_deferred("_on_HitBox_area_entered_deferred", area)

func _on_HitBox_area_entered_deferred(area):
    # Inject all the code here that was originally in _on_HitBox_area_entered
```

## Spawning Stuff

in order to spawn something, it first needs to be instantiated from a `Resource` and then added as a child with `add_child()`. it inherits its spawner's `transform`, though. to prevent this, either spawn it as a child of a specific Node or set it's CanvasItem's `Top Level` property to `true` in the inspector.

e.g.

```
var ice_spear: IceSpear = ice_spear_resource.instantiate()	
# get_node("/root/World").add_child(ice_spear)
# get_parent().add_child(ice_spear)
add_child(ice_spear)
```
